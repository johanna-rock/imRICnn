## Usage

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/johanna-rock/im_ricnn.git`
2. Create a virtual environment from the included environment.yml and activate it
	1. Create using conda: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
	2. Activate using conda: `conda activate im-cnn-env`
3. Set the python path using `export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/imRICnn"`
4. Download simulated sample data from [https://cloud.tugraz.at/index.php/s/6GEjJaGcf7eKp2B](https://cloud.tugraz.at/index.php/s/6GEjJaGcf7eKp2B), unzip the file and save it to `imRICnn/data/radar-data`.

## Training
Run `python -m run_scripts.run_training.py` to train and evaluate a CNN with the configuration specified in run_training.py.

## Evaluation
Run `python -m run_scripts.run_evaluation.py` to evaluate a pre-trained model with the configuration specified in run_evaluation.py.
